title: About Mark
---
A small hotel owner on a tropical island in Panama once came up with an idea. His guests have been taking selfies on the beach and beautiful grounds all the time, but nobody knew it was his hotel. He wanted to change that. So he reached out to his techie friend in San Francisco.

That's how Mark was born.
